        <h2>About The Club</h2>
        <p>The University of South Carolina Cybersecurity Club is a student-led organization meant to provide education and social 
            opportunities to anyone interested in the widespread field of cybersecurity. We strive to promote our members to learn 
            many different cybersecurity principles and concepts both during our meeting times and on their own. This learning is 
            done through our weekly meetings with presentations by other club members, participation in events/competitions, and 
            the sharing of knowledge and resources between each of our members. We want to support anyone who is interested in any 
            aspect of cybersecurity. Any student of any skill level is welcome to join our discord and come to our meetings with no 
            prior knowledge required.</p>

            <h2>About The Meetings</h2>
            <p>We have our weekly meetings on Wednesdays from 6:00-7:30 pm inside of Swearingen 2A17. Though this information 
                sometimes changes, and our Discord server is the best place to know about any changes. The first 30 minutes of 
                the meetings is generally a time to be social and have some food while enjoying each other’s company. Then we 
                move into a classroom where we will have some form of learning experience, whether it’s a presentation by a club 
                member or hands on lab that you could do from your laptop.</p>

        <h2>About Our Plans</h2>
        <p>We also plan to be competing in various Capture The Flag (CTF) online competitions. These CTFs are generally online web-based 
            cybersecurity competitions hosted by other institutions and groups. These competitions are composed of various challenges focused 
            on a specific topic in cybersecurity. The most common topics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cryptography</li>
            <li>Web Exploitation</li>
            <li>Reverse Engineering</li>
            <li>Forensics</li>
            <li>Binary Exploitation / PWN</li>
            <li>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on these categories and CTFs in general, go to the resources page to find the “Capture The Flag Introduction” (link) presentation for a basic overview.
            Another major competition we plan on competing in will be Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition (PCDC). This is a yearly event held in 
            South Carolina which focuses on the defensive side of cybersecurity. This event has a team of 6 people from our club try to defend 
            a created cyber network from a team of hackers, which are from the US Military. For more information on this event, go to the resources 
            page to find the “PCDC Introduction” presentation for a basic overview.</p>
