        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                How do I join the club?<br>
                There is no official joining process, just come to the meetings and join the discord.
            </li>
            <li>
                When and where are the meetings?<br>
                The meetings are on Wednesdays from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm in Swearingen room 2A17, on the second floor in the A wing. The first 30 minutes of meetings 
                are meant for social interaction and eating food provided by the club, after which we move into a nearby classroom depending on which are open to 
                have learning opportunities. If anything changes, it will be posted in the discord #annoucements channel.

            <li>
                How much do I need to know about cybersecurity before joining?<br>
                You don’t need to know anything before joining, we plan to teach and instruct our club members the basics of cybersecurity and provide them the 
                resources and guidance to delve deeper into any specific area of cybersecurity.
            </li>
            <li>
                What technology do I need to participate in the club activities?<br>
                We recommend having a laptop with a Kali Linux virtual machine. Just about any laptop will be able to install a Linux virtual machine, we will have 
                a meeting to install the virtual machine and learn Linux basics, the presentation will also be posted on the Resources page.
            </li>
            <li>
                When is the next… (CTF, event, meeting, etc)?<br>
                All events, meetings, or CTFs will be posted in the discord in the #annoucements channel. Also look in the events tab for a list of everything happening 
                soon. However, the meetings are generally on Wednesdays from 6-7:30. CTFs are usually weekend long events starting on Fridays and ending Sunday afternoons, 
                though if we plan to meet up to do them in person, we will post those plans on discord.
            </li>
            <li>
                Will you post the presentations from the meetings online?<br>
                Yes, we try to post all of our resources on the resources tab under “Meeting Presentations”. These are usually posted by the end of the night, If they are 
                not please contact the CTO, Jake Sherer on the Contact Us page.
            </li>
            <li>
                I want to learn more about…. Where should I start?<br>
                Look on the Resources page under “Learning Websites”, that is a good place to start. If none of those websites have the topic you’re looking for, contact 
                the officers on Discord using @Officer, send an email on the Contact Us page, or talk to us in person at the next meeting.
